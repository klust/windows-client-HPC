Yes, this is perfectly possible.  It can even be done using mostly free software (besides of course Windows itself).

This is a protocol that is optimized for large data transfers over high-latency connections that may even lack reliability.</p> <p>Globus data transfers happen between so-called endpoints. The endpoint software can be installed on big file servers -- and many supercomputer centers will offer a Globus endpoint to access your data there -- but there is also more feature-limited \"personal endpoint\" software to turn your desktop or laptop in a Globus endpoint. However, you don't need any specific software to initiate a data transfer between two endpoints. This is done via a web interface provided by the Globus service (globus.org). In this process, your actual data does not pass through the Globus.org servers nor through the computer on which you initiate the transfer but is transferred directly between the two end points. If connections get interrupted, data transfer will be restarted automatically when the connection is restored.</p> <p>So, among others, you can:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Transfer data between a supercomputer and a file server on your     department (provided both are Globus endpoints), initiating the     transfer from your laptop or even smartphone. Ones the data transfer     is initiated, there is no need to keep your laptop or smartphone     connected as it is not directly involved in the data transfer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transfer data between two supercomputers on which you have an     account (which really is exactly the same case as the previous one).</p> </li> <li> <p>Transfer data to or from your laptop. In this case, you need to     install personal endpoint software on your laptop and register it     with the globus.org service. However, you can unplug your laptop     from the network while the data transfer is going on. The data     transfer will automatically resume when your laptop is on the     network again. This makes this a lot more user-friendly technology     to transfer large amounts of data than sftp, as sftp connections do     not automatically restart when interrupted.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"2_LinuxOnWin/","title":"Creating a linux-like environment on Windows","text":"<ul> <li>WSL and WSL2</li> <li>CygWin</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2_LinuxOnWin/2_01_WSL/","title":"WSL and WSL 2","text":"<p>Windows Subsystem for Linux  is a product of Microsoft to emulate a Linux environment on top of Windows.

It makes use of the kernel structure of the NT-based Windows versions (which is basically every version of Windows from Windows XP on), which can support subsystems that then can implement OS emulation. The original Windows NT kernel already had a POSIX subsystem as POSIX compatibility was a requirement to be able to sell Windows to certain USA government agencies.  Already in the '90s a third party company, Softway Systems, developed a more extensive UNIX emulation,  originally called OpenNT and later renamed to Interix. That technology required a re-compilation of UNIX software though. Microsoft acquired that technology and used it for a while in some Windows versions without much further development. However, it is rather  likely that WSL 1 found its roots in that technology, though most sources claim that it  started with an effort to try to run some Android applications on a version of Windows 10, a technology that was never released in its original form.</p> <p>WSL 1 differs from OpenNT/Interix in that it offers Linux compatibility and runs native Linux  binaries. It launched in 2016 with Windows 10.</p> <p>It was possible to install several versions of Linux on top of the subsystem.

It actually runs a real Linux kernel with just a few modifications in a virtual machine. It also can run several Linux distributions which effectively run in containers but share the single kernel.

In particular, as it runs a  separate kernel, file access to Windows files is much slower than in WSL 1, but it has its own virtual file systems (per distribution) that are much faster than anything WSL 1 could offer.</p> <p>The WSL 2 subsystem has now also been extended with support for Wayland graphics (and X11 on top of Wayland). This technology was first only available in Windows 11 but has since been ported to Windows 10 also. It works through the remote display protocol, but it is completely transparent to users.

This is a version of WSL2 that contains built-in support for WSL (dubbed WSLg). Windows 11 will render the image in the Linux server and push the image to the Windows screen via the Remote Display Protocol, but also include features to support OpenGL acceleration on the graphics card if a compatible Windows display driver is used. </p> <p>In the past, there were several commercial X servers that offered much better performance than the freely available ones. These however have lost popularity, especially when the server running the X applications is not on the same very fast network, as the limited network bandwidth and higher latency of longer network connections obliterate any speed advantage over the free alternatives (though some might still offer more functionality).</p> <p>There are several X servers that are all derived from the X.org code base. Packaging those to run on Windows does require some effort from the developers of these packages, so some of the options below request a minor fee or donation to compensate for that effort.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Cygwin/X. Cygwin is a technology that     offers a lot of Linux-functionality on top of Windows. This     technology is discussed elsewhere. It also comes with an X server     derived from the X.org code base. However, as one also needs to     install the Cygwin system before being able to install the X server,     it does require some more effort from the user than the other     options given below. It is however entirely free.</p> </li> <li> <p>MobaTek MobaXterm: This product     was already discussed before. It's X-server is also based on the     X.org sources and in fact relies on the built-in Cygwin. However,     due to the integration in MobaXterm the interface is a bit more     polished. The MobaXterm does support the GLX extension, but it is     not clear if it is hardware accelerated or just a software OpenGL     emulation. Recent versions integrate nicely with WSL also (tested     with WSL2) and set the DISPLAY environment variable correctly so     that you can start X programs in your WSL sessions started from     MobaXterm. TODO: TEST ON A CLEAN MACHINE AS IT MAY PICK UP A     VARIABLE SET BY GWSL.</p> </li> <li> <p>GWSL: This free X server installs     from the Microsoft Store which makes it extremely easy to install     and gives you automatic updates. It is based on VcXsrv, the next one     in this list, but installs from the Windows store. It has a feature     to ensure that each WSL session starts with the display variable set     properly and a simple tool to create shortcuts to WSL graphical apps     to start them at the click of a button. GWSL does support the GLX     1.4 extension, but it is not clear if it is hardware accelerated or     just a software OpenGL emulation. Like all X servers further down in     the list, it is basically the work of a single person so there is no     guarantee that the work will continue and limited support.</p> <p>A big disadvantage of this X server is that it runs with access control disabled, allowing all computers on the network to access the X server unless the firewall on your machine stops the applications from doing so. But tuning the firewall to only let traffic from the WSL virtual machine pass is no easy feat, also because the feature that sets the DISPLAY variable doesn't use the internal virtual connection. It may be a good enough X server to use at home but it should not be used in public spaces or on, e.g., a university network.</p> </li> <li> <p>VcXsrv: This X server     runs independently from the Cygwin libraries. It relies on an older     version of the Microsoft compilers and some included libraries that     make Cygwin unnecessary. It is installed through a regular Windows     installer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Xming X Server: This     is another server that can run independently from Cygwin. While     VcXsrv uses the Microsoft compilers, the author of Xming relies on a     port of the GNU compiler collection (though of course you don't need     to have those compilers installed). It consists of two components:     the actual X server and a package with additional fonts. The server     is donationware (a minimum of 10 GBP will give you access to new     versions for a year), though an older version is available entirely     free. The donationware version does support the GLX extension. For     the free versions, there is a download with (the -mesa version) and     without GLX, but the GLX support is very outdated (GLX 1.2) given     that the free version is essentially the 2007 version of Xming. It     is installed through a regular Windows installer. Xming works nicely     with WSL1 as you can simply set the DISPLAY variable to localhost     but is a bit more tricky to use with WSL2, which runs in a virtual     machine and hence doesn't share localhost with Windows.

In most (all?) WSL distributions, this should be on an     internal Linux file system. So in case you use your Windows home     directory also as the home directory in your WSL distribution, you     should not put the socket there. This is why <code>/home/$USER</code> is used     rather than <code>$HOME</code>. Also, if you have multiple Linux distributions     in WSL, it is important that the socket has a different name for     each distribution as otherwise one distribution will try to talk to     a socket in a different distribution. At first this may seem     possible since all distributions run in the same virtual machine,     but they have different user spaces so that does not work.</p> </li> <li> <p>The second line tests if there is already an <code>socat</code> process managing     that socket.</p> </li> <li> <p>The crucial line is the <code>setsid socat</code> line:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The Windows ssh agent works with Windows named pipes, and WSL2     programs cannot directly talk to those. This is where     <code>npiperelay.exe</code> comes in. It acts as the translator between Linux     sockets and the Windows named pipe.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>socat</code> process listens at the Linux side. Whenever ssh     contacts the socket, it starts <code>npiperelay.exe</code> to talk to the     Windows named pipe. The <code>npiperelay.exe</code> process is started with     options that will terminate it after the command from the ssh     process.</p> </li> <li> <p>The path specified for the <code>npiperelay.exe</code> command is the path as     seen by the Linux distribution.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>setsid</code> command is used to start it in a separate session so     that it continues running if the current Linux session is     terminated, to be picked up again when you start a new shell in     that distribution.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>At the moment of writing, this process was tested and works in Fedora 38, OpenSUSE 15 SP4 and Ubuntu 22.4.2 LTS.

And this in turn seems to be related to a permissions problem in WSL2 when using a Windows file system: It is not possible to set the permissions on the links themselves to 700 while that seems to be needed for the Ubuntu ssh client (according to a web search on possible causes).
